Hello
This is my first gui project.
I use C++ with sfml on VS 2022.
Since I am mostly a beginner my code can be inefficient and repetitive,but I believe its good enough.
This project takes input of resistances and a voltage from user and returns the current,potential drop and power consumed
through each resistor,each group of parallel combination and the entire combination.
The first input is the number of series resistors kinda like the number of columns.
Then for every column,the number of resistors in parallel are taken as input and individual resistance of each is also taken into account.
Finally after all resistors are done, the total voltage across the combination is taken.
All the details of each resistor is given along with the net result at end.
In a new window , a diagram is made where cyan colored blocks indicate individual resistors and green outlined blocks indicate a parallel combination.
Clicking outside the green outlines gives you the net details.
