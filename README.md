# Electronic Circuit Simulator (SFML)

This project visualizes basic electronic and physics concepts using **SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)**.  
It demonstrates how to simulate and render components of an electronic circuit â€” wires, resistors, and voltage sources â€” using real-time graphics.

### Features
- Built with **C++ and SFML**
- Simple visual simulation of circuit behavior
- Easy-to-run Windows executable

### How to Run
Download the ZIP from the releases section, extract, and run the `.exe` file.
